# 15-Days-Python-Project-Challange-For-Analysis

📌 Overview

This repository documents my journey through a 15-day challenge where I analyze 15 different datasets using Python.
The goal of this challenge is to strengthen my data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills while uncovering meaningful real-world insights.

Each project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights with the help of Python libraries.

⚡ Tech Stack & Tools

* Programming Language: Python 🐍

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Environment: Jupyter Notebook

* Datasets: Kaggle & other open-source datasets

🎯 Objectives of the Challenge

* Practice daily hands-on analysis with diverse datasets

* Improve data storytelling through visualizations

* Explore real-world domains (ecommerce, education, health, entertainment, salaries, etc.)

* Build a portfolio of 15 analysis projects to showcase data analysis skills

📌 Typical Workflow (per project)

-- Dataset Overview – Structure, shape, missing values, and data types

-- Data Cleaning – Handling nulls, removing duplicates, standardizing values

-- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Descriptive stats, filtering, grouping

-- Visualizations – Charts & plots (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for insights

-- Key Findings – Actionable insights & real-world applications

🔥 Takeaway

This challenge is not just about writing Python code — it’s about thinking like an analyst.
By the end of the 15 projects, I aim to demonstrate:

Stronger Python for Data Analysis skills

The ability to extract business insights from diverse datasets

A solid portfolio of end-to-end projects
