# 🚢 Python Project 15/15 – Titanic Survivor Analysis 🎯

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous in data science.
But instead of just crunching numbers, I wanted to revisit the story hidden in the data.

So, using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), I asked:
👉 Who had better survival odds?
👉 Did money and class really matter?
👉 How did age and gender influence fate?

🔍 Key Insights from My Analysis

✅ Gender – Women had significantly higher survival rates than men.
✅ Passenger Class – 1st class passengers had far better survival chances compared to 3rd class.
✅ Age Factor – Children had slightly better odds than adults, but overall, age was less decisive than class or gender.
✅ Fare & Wealth – Passengers with higher ticket fares tended to survive more, showing how privilege played a role even in tragedy.

🛠 Tools & Techniques

* Pandas → cleaning & wrangling missing data
* Seaborn → survival visualizations (gender, class, fare distributions)
* Matplotlib → storytelling through graphs

✨ What struck me the most was how the dataset confirms what history told us: “Women and children first” wasn’t just a phrase, it’s visible in the data.

💡 My takeaway: Data analysis isn’t just about numbers — it’s about uncovering the human stories behind them.

👉 If you were onboard, do you think your class, age, or gender would have influenced your odds of survival?
