## 🎯 Python Project 9/15 – Udemy Courses Analysis 🎓📊

We all know Udemy as a go-to platform for online learning.

But behind the scenes, I wanted to uncover:

👉 Which subjects dominate the platform?

👉 Do free courses actually attract more learners?

👉 What makes a course "best-selling"?

So, I dove into a dataset of Udemy courses using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) — and here’s what I discovered:

🔍 Key Insights from My Analysis

* ✅ Subject Leaders – Web Development topped the charts with 1,200+ courses, far more than other subjects like Business Finance or Graphic Design.
* ✅ Paid vs Free – Udemy thrives on its paid model: 3,372 courses are paid, while only a fraction are free.
* ✅ Best-Sellers – Some courses gathered massive subscriber counts, becoming the platform’s flagships, while others struggled with minimal reach.
* ✅ Price Filters – Interesting patterns emerged: Graphic Design thrives under $100, while Web Development has plenty of premium-priced options above $50.
* ✅ Python’s Popularity – Extracting Python courses revealed how central this skill is in online learning. 🐍
* ✅ 2015 Boom – Over 1,000 courses launched in 2015, showing a key expansion phase for Udemy.
* ✅ Learning Levels – Beginner and "All Levels" courses attracted the largest subscriber base, proving accessibility drives engagement.

🛠 Tools & Techniques

* Pandas → data wrangling
* Matplotlib & Seaborn → trend visualizations
* Filtering & Queries → deep dives into subject, price, and time-based patterns

✨ This project wasn’t just about data—it told the story of how pricing, subject, and accessibility shape the success of online education.

💡 My takeaway: Affordable, beginner-friendly courses dominate learner engagement, but specialized premium content still holds strong value.

👉 What’s your preference when learning online — short affordable courses or in-depth premium programs?
