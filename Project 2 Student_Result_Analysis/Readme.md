# 🐍 Python Data Analyst Project – 2/15

# 🎯 Student Result Analysis

For my second project in the 15 Python Data Analysis Projects challenge, I analyzed student academic performance data to uncover trends, correlations, and demographic patterns.

🔎 Objective:

To evaluate how factors like gender, ethnicity, and parental background influence Math, Reading, and Writing scores using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

✨ Key Highlights from the Analysis:
* 🧹 Data Cleaning: Removed redundant features, standardized inconsistent values, and validated datatypes.
* 📊 Gender Distribution: Slight overrepresentation of female students.
* 🎓 Parental Education Impact: Higher parental education strongly correlates with improved student scores.
* 👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Marital Status: Some categories showed notable differences in student performance.
* 📈 Score Distribution: Boxplots revealed outliers and variation across Math, Reading & Writing.
* 🌍 Ethnic Group Representation: Visualized demographic breakdown to understand performance diversity.


📌 Takeaway:
This project highlights how socio-demographic factors significantly influence academic performance. Such insights can help educators, policymakers, and institutions design targeted learning support strategies.

🔥 Two projects completed, 13 more to go! Excited to keep sharing insights as I progress.
