# 🐍 Python Data Analyst Project – 8/30
# Google Play Store Apps Analysis 📱✨

Have you ever wondered what makes an app successful on the Google Play Store? 🌍

With over 10,000+ apps in my dataset, I decided to dig into the world of mobile apps to uncover patterns behind ratings, installs, categories, and reviews — all with the help of Python + Pandas.

🔍 The Exploration Journey
It started with a dataset of 10,841 rows & 13 features, including app name, category, ratings, installs, price, content rating, and more. After cleaning and exploring, the story behind the apps began to unfold.

📊 What I Discovered

* 🔮 Found how many apps contain the term “Astrology” in their title 🌌
* ⭐ Calculated the average rating across the store
* 🗂 Identified unique app categories & discovered which one scored the highest average rating
* 🏆 Counted how many apps achieved a perfect 5-star rating
* 📈 Found the app with the maximum reviews & listed the top 5 most reviewed apps
* 💰 Compared free vs paid apps in terms of count and average rating
* 📥 Highlighted the top 5 apps with the most installs (truly the market leaders!)

💡 The Insight
This analysis shows that app data is more than just downloads and ratings — it’s a reflection of user trust, engagement, and evolving digital trends. For businesses, it’s a guide to building apps that people truly value.

🔥 That’s Project 8/30 in my Python Data Analysis journey — each dataset feels like opening a new world of hidden insights!

👉 If you could analyze any one factor from the Play Store — would you look at ratings, installs, or categories first?
