# 🚀 Python Project 14/15 – Job & Salary Analysis in Data Science 💼💰

Have you ever wondered… “How much do Data Scientists earn across the world?” 🌍
Or whether company size, work setting, or experience level really influences salary? 🤔

That’s exactly what I explored in my latest project — analyzing a rich dataset of Data Science jobs & salaries from Kaggle.

🔎 The Dataset

* Covers job roles like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst
* Includes salary (local currency & USD), work year, employee residence, company size, work setting, and more.
* Over 10,000 records, giving a real-world picture of salary trends.

🛠 Steps in My Analysis

* ✅ Data Cleaning – handled duplicates, missing values, and standardized categories
* ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – uncovering global salary patterns
* ✅ Salary Comparisons – by role, experience, country, and company size
* ✅ Work Setting Impact – Does remote really pay more? (Spoiler: yes, often!)
* ✅ Trends Over Years – salary growth in the data field

📊 Key Insights

* 📌 Experience matters most – Executives & Senior professionals earn significantly higher salaries globally.
* 📌 Remote jobs often have a salary edge 💻 compared to in-person roles.
* 📌 Company size plays a role – larger firms usually offer better pay, but not always.
* 📌 Geography matters – salaries vary widely depending on employee residence vs. company location.

🧩 Tools & Techniques

* Pandas & NumPy → Data wrangling
* Seaborn & Matplotlib → Visual storytelling through plots
* EDA → uncovering trends that numbers alone can’t show

✨ This project gave me valuable insights into how data tells the story of careers in our field.
