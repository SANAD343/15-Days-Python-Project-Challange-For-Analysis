# 📺 Python Data Analyst Project – 5/15
🔄 Netflix TV Shows & Movies Analysis

For this project, I analyzed a dataset from Flixable (via Kaggle) to explore trends in Netflix’s global content library — from movies and TV shows to categories, directors, and country-wise distributions.

🎬 Dataset Overview:

7,789 rows | 11 columns

Features include title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and type

🧹 Data Preparation:

* Removed duplicates with drop_duplicates()
* Checked for and visualized missing values using a Seaborn heatmap

🔍 Key Insights & Tasks:

* 🔑 Identified the Show ID & Director of House of Cards
* 📈 Found the year with the highest number of releases (bar graph)
* 🎭 Analyzed distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
* 🎬 Count of Movies released in 2020
* 🌏 TV shows exclusive to India
* 🎥 Top 10 directors on Netflix
* 😂 Extracted Comedy titles & UK-specific releases
* ⭐ Count of Netflix appearances by Tom Cruise
* 🔖 Explored unique ratings & TV-14 titles in Canada
* ⏱ Found the maximum duration of Netflix content
* 📺 Country with the highest number of TV shows
* 📌 Sorted dataset by release year to identify historical trends

📌 Takeaway:
This analysis highlights how Python + Pandas + Seaborn can turn entertainment data into insights on content strategy, global reach, and audience preferences.

🔥 That’s Project 5/15 in my data analysis journey — and definitely one of the most fun datasets to explore so far!
