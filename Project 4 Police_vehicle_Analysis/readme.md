# 👮‍♂️ Python Data Analyst Project – 4/15

🔍 Police Vehicle Checking Dataset Analysis

After exploring ecommerce, education, and Covid-19 datasets in my earlier projects, I wanted to analyze something different — data that reflects law enforcement and traffic behavior. 🚦

For this project, I worked on a police check post dataset to uncover patterns in traffic stops using Python (Pandas). My focus was on cleaning, filtering, grouping, and statistical analysis to see what the numbers reveal.

Here’s what I found:

* 🧹 Data Cleaning – Removed irrelevant columns (like country_name) for a cleaner dataset.
* ⚡ Speeding Violations – Value counts showed which gender was stopped more often for speeding.
* 👮 Search Patterns – Grouped by driver gender to compare how often male vs female drivers were searched during stops.
* ⏱ Stop Duration – Converted categorical stop durations into numeric values and calculated the average stop time.
* 📊 Age & Violations – Explored age distributions across different violations, revealing how offenses varied across age groups.

📌 Key Takeaway:

This analysis shows how data can bring transparency and accountability to law enforcement practices. From speeding patterns to search likelihoods, these insights can support policy-making, fairness checks, and operational efficiency.

🔥 That’s Project 4/15 complete! Each dataset so far has opened the door to a different side of real-world decision-making.
