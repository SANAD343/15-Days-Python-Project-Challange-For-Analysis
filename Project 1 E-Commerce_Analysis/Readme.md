Dataset: Ecommerce Purchases (Kaggle)

I’ve just kicked off my 15 Python Data Analysis Projects challenge, and the first one is all about Ecommerce Purchases Analysis 📊.


🔎 Objective:

To explore customer behavior, purchase trends, and hidden insights in real-world ecommerce data while sharpening Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) skills.
✨ Key Highlights from My Analysis:
* 📂 Data Exploration: Checked dataset structure, missing values & data types.
* 💰 Purchase Insights: Identified highest, lowest & average purchase prices.
* 🌐 Customer Diversity: Mapped most spoken languages & filtered job roles (like Engineers).
* 📧 Email & Cards: Found patterns in credit card usage, email domains, and high-value transactions.
* ⏰ Shopping Time Trends: Compared AM vs PM purchase behavior.
* 💳 Expiry Analysis: Counted customers with cards expiring in 2020 (business opportunity for renewal offers).
* 🏆 Top 5 Email Providers: Ranked the most common among shoppers.


📌 Takeaway:
This project revealed actionable business insights such as spending behavior, peak shopping times, and customer segmentation opportunities — all crucial for personalized marketing & improved customer experience.
🔥 One project down, 14 more to go! Excited to keep building and sharing.
