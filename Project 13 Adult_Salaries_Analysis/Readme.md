# 🐍 Python Data Analyst Project – 13/15
## 🌍 Adult Demographics & Income Analysis

Data has a way of uncovering the stories behind society — our work, education, and even how these shape income levels. 
For this project, I explored the Adult Demographics & Income Dataset (48,842 rows, 15 features) from Kaggle to dive deeper into what factors influence income patterns.

✅ Step 1: Data Cleaning

* 🧹 Removed missing & duplicate records to ensure reliability.
* 🗑 Dropped irrelevant columns (like capital-gain & capital-loss) for sharper insights.
* 🔄 Encoded income values (<=50K → 0, >50K → 1) for analysis.

✅ Step 2: Univariate Analysis

* 📊 Age Distribution: Most individuals fell within the 25–45 age group, a critical working demographic.
* 🏢 Workclass: Histograms revealed the dominance of Private sector jobs.
* 🎓 Education: Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees stood out, showing a higher frequency of individuals at this level.

✅ Step 3: Bivariate Analysis

* 💼 Workclass vs Income: Certain work categories (like Government & Professional roles) tended to yield higher average salaries.
* 👩‍🦱👨‍🦰 Gender vs Income: Men were statistically more likely to fall into the >50K income group, highlighting income disparity.
* 🔄 Converted categorical fields for better grouping and comparisons.

💡 Key Insights

* Education strongly correlates with higher earnings, but not all degrees carry equal weight.
* Gender disparity in salaries persists, even when controlled for workclass.
* Workclass type plays a major role in predicting income potential.

🎯 The Big Picture
This project demonstrates how demographic datasets can help policy-makers, economists, and organizations identify gaps in education, gender pay equity, and occupational income opportunities.

👉 Question for you:
Do you believe education or work experience plays a bigger role in achieving higher income today?
