# 🐍 Python Data Analyst Project – 11/15
# 💓 Heart Disease Dataset Analysis

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. But what if data could help us understand patterns, risk factors, and demographics more clearly?

I explored the Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover insights into how age, gender, chest pain, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels relate to heart disease.

🔍 My Journey Through the Data

📍 Data Preparation

* Imported libraries and cleaned the dataset.
* Removed duplicates to ensure accuracy.

📍 Feature Relationships

* Built a correlation matrix heatmap to identify strong links between clinical factors.

📍 Heart Disease Incidence

* Count plot showed a clear split between individuals with vs. without heart disease.

📍 Demographic Insights

* Gender distribution revealed more male patients than female.
* When linked to the target variable, males showed a higher incidence of heart disease.

📍 Age & Risk Factors

* Age histogram showed that most patients were middle-aged to older adults.
* Chest pain analysis revealed certain chest pain types had a stronger correlation with heart disease.

📍 Clinical Measures

* Fasting blood sugar distribution hinted at differences between diseased and non-diseased groups.
* Resting blood pressure & cholesterol distributions highlighted significant variations across patients.
* Comparison by gender showed males often had higher resting blood pressure.

💡 Key Takeaways

* Age, gender, and chest pain type play a critical role in predicting heart disease.
* Clinical measures like blood pressure and cholesterol remain strong indicators.
* Combining demographic + clinical data creates a more powerful risk assessment framework.

🎯 Big Picture
This project shows how data analysis in healthcare can provide actionable insights, helping doctors and policymakers target high-risk groups more effectively.

👉 If you were designing a healthcare dashboard, which metric would you prioritize to monitor heart health trends?
