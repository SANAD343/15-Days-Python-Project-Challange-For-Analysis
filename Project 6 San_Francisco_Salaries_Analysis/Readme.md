# 💵 Python Data Analyst Project – 6/15

# San Francisco Employee Salary Analysis 💰

For this project, I analyzed the salary dataset of San Francisco city employees (sourced from Kaggle) to uncover patterns in pay, job titles, and employee demographics.

💳 Dataset Overview:

* 148,654 entries | 13 columns
* Features include employee name, job title, base pay, overtime pay, benefits, and total pay

🧹 Data Cleaning:
* Checked and handled missing values
* Dropped less relevant columns (Id, Notes, Agency, Status)
* Standardized “Not Provided” values for accurate analysis

🔍 Key Insights & Analysis:

* 👨‍💼 Identified unique job titles & top 5 most common ones
* 🚒 Counted job titles containing “Captain” & listed Fire Department employees
* 💵 BasePay Analysis: Found minimum, maximum & average base pay, plus the employee with the highest BasePay

📈 Grouped Insights:

* Average BasePay by year
* Average BasePay by job title
* Average BasePay for specific roles (e.g., Accountant)

📌 Takeaway:
This project highlights how salary data can provide transparency into compensation trends, reveal disparities across roles, and help organizations benchmark pay structures more effectively.

🔥 That’s Project 6/15 in my data analysis journey — diving deeper into real-world datasets every step of the way!
