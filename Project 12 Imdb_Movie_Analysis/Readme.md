# 🐍 Python Data Analyst Project – 12/15
# 🎬 IMDB Movie Dataset (2006–2016) Analysis

Movies aren’t just entertainment — they’re data-rich stories waiting to be told. From box office revenue to audience ratings, every film leaves behind a trail of insights.

For this project, I analyzed the IMDB Movie Dataset (2006–2016) using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover trends in genres, ratings, revenue, and audience preferences.

⚡ Step 1: Data Cleaning

* Visualized missing values with a heatmap & removed them for accuracy.
* Checked for and dropped duplicates to ensure clarity.

⚡ Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Calculated overall statistics to understand movie runtime, ratings, votes, and revenue.
* Found the longest movies and compared yearly averages of votes & revenue.
* Explored the link between ratings and box office revenue.

⚡ Step 3: Top Movies & Genre Insights

* Identified top-grossing & highest-rated movies.
* Classified movies into “Excellent,” “Good,” and “Average” categories based on ratings.
* Counted Action movies (a fan favorite 💥) and explored all unique genres.

🎨 Visualization Highlights:

* Heatmaps for missing values
* Scatter plots for rating vs. revenue
* Bar plots for genre distributions & top movies

💡 Key Takeaways

* High ratings don’t always guarantee high revenue 💵 — and vice versa.
* Certain genres (Action & Drama) consistently dominate the charts.
* Audience preferences shift year to year, but quality storytelling (high rating) often stands the test of time.

🎯 Big Picture:
This project shows how analyzing entertainment data can reveal patterns that guide studios, directors, and even streaming platforms in understanding what audiences truly value.

👉 If you had the chance, would you trust audience ratings or box office revenue more as a measure of a movie’s success? 🎥
