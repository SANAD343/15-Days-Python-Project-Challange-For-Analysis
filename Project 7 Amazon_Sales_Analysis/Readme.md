# 🚀 Python Data Analyst Project – 7/15 🐍
# Amazon Sales Analysis 🛒📈

Imagine standing inside Amazon’s massive marketplace — millions of orders flowing in, customers clicking Buy Now, and businesses competing for attention.

As a data analyst, I got the chance to peek behind the curtain through a sales dataset of 128,976 orders (21 features!) — and here’s what I discovered using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn:

## 🔍 The Journey
Every dataset tells a story. Mine began with cleaning messy columns like ‘New’ and ‘PendingS’, fixing missing values, and converting ‘Date’ into a proper datetime format. Once the noise was gone, the signals started to emerge.

📊 What the Data Revealed

* 👕 Size Trends: Medium (M) size products dominated the sales — fashion truly has a favorite size!
* 📦 Fulfilment & Shipping: Amazon itself is the leading fulfilment channel, with courier shipping being the go-to method.
* 🏷 Category Insights: T-shirts emerged as the undisputed leader in purchases.
* 🛍 Buyer Type: A whopping 99.3% of buyers were retailers vs. B2B businesses.
*
* 🗺 Geography: Maharashtra topped the charts with the highest number of customers.

💡 The Takeaway
Sales data isn’t just numbers — it’s about what people prefer, how they buy, and where demand truly lies. With the right tools, we can connect the dots between customer behavior and business strategy.

🔥 That’s Project 7/15 in my Data Analysis journey — each dataset feels like opening a new chapter in the world of insights!

👉 What’s one metric you’d be most curious to analyze if you had Amazon’s sales data?
